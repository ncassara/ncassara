## I'm Nicole (Nikki), a data science student at the University of Rochester ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about using data to drive meaningful change, particularly on projects that improve healthcare outcomes. Whether it's analyzing trends, building predictive models, or developing tools to support decision-making, I love working on data-driven solutions that help others and make a positive impact in their lives. Outside of academics, I play lacrosse for my university's varsity lacrosse team and work in a NICU as an administrative assistant. I'm also a certified EMT-B and you can find me working club sports games as a medic or for my university's on-campus emergency response team, where I also serve as the Statistics Chair! Moreso, I enjoy helping others learn statistics, and I get to teach an R programming lab as part of my responsibilites as a Teaching Assistant for the Statistics Department.

I like to keep myself busy!
