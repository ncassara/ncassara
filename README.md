## I'm Nicole (Nikki), a data science student at the University of Rochester ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Nikki, a senior Data Science student at the University of Rochester with a passion for using data to improve patient care outcomes. My background combines mathematics, statistics, and computer science, along with hands-on experience in the pharmaceutical industry.

Iâ€™ve interned with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in both Clinical Experimental Science and Global Clinical Trial Services, where I built dashboards in PowerBI and supported trial management and site start-up operations. On campus, Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from neural networks for real-time cardiac monitoring in firefighters to streamlining graduate admissions data using Python.

Outside the classroom, Iâ€™m a member of the Varsity Womenâ€™s Lacrosse team and a volunteer EMT with my universityâ€™s Medical Emergency Response Team, where I also serve as statistics chair and present reports on call data. In addition, I work as a paid EMT with Brighton Ambulance, further strengthening my experience in patient care.
